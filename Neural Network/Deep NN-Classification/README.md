<h1>Classification using Deep Neural Networks(without CNN)</h1>
In this code, we make classification of hand signs using dense neural networks. We converted the images into numpy array and then passed them in the model layers.<br>
The link for the dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/ingbiodanielh/signsv2

Another example of classification can be seen in this repository, where classification is performed on MNIST dataset.
